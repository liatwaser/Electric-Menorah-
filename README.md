Electric-Menorah-
=================
Hello! 

Hanukkah is an awesome holiday! 
It's even better if you can use an Electric Menorah! 
This project requires an Arduino (I used Uno) and Processing.

You can check out my blog post about this project here: http://liatwaser.wordpress.com/2013/12/13/electric-menorah-attempt/

Enjoy!
